1.
WRT to your 2nd question
"  3   X11 6  X12 8 "
yes you stated there are 3 symbol definitions , you provide 2 so the parser is looking
for the 3rd one ( see the pseudo code I provided where there is a for loop ).
Since there is no 3rd one, the error is SYM_EXPECTED

2.
symbol length 太长 超过16 报啥错

3.是否可以assume symbol 后面的 relative address 是valided 不会出现 021 0002 这样的address

4。 relative address exceed module size  >=

5. external address exceed length of uselist 


even an empty program should have the “Symbol Table” and “Memory Map” line
